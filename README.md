## Inspiration
The Slack communication interface inspired us in how online communication in the workplace ought to function to best serve a company. Workplace equality training is an important aspect in creating a safe work environment for everyone, and our product intends to make this training easier and more accessible.

## What it does
It creates an open and unjudgemental discussion board for employees to discuss and ask questions they may otherwise be afraid to ask. A series of training videos allows companies to educate and test their employees to best create a safe and comfortable work environment.
## How we built it
We started with a series of sketched interaction flows to layout our app. Using Sketch and proto.io, we created a low-fidelity product that allows testers to pretend they are using our final app. 

## Challenges we ran into

In the beginning, securing an idea of what our product would accomplish was difficult with many changes in the design. However, we agreed on EqualHub, and began working on the design.  While designing the interaction flow, we ran into some challenges in how security would be implemented, but we were able to consult various mentors and decide on a good prototype. To continue, throughout the process, it was difficult to coordinate working on different parts of the product on different devices and combining the separate parts into one at the end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One thing we learned today is learning new techniques for prototyping the app, at a conceptual level. We learned how to use proto.io and Sketch, and the difficulties in integrating work from multiple mediums and across platforms. 


## What's next for EqualHub
The next step for Equal Hub is to deep analyze the architecture overview of our app. And a more detailed prototype with some concrete implementation.
